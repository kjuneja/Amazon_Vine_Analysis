## Summary

In Conclusion we can say that 51% of the reviews in the Vine program were 5 stars reviews whereas the percentage in the non-Vine reviews is only 39%. This describes a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program.
Additionally we could analyse the vine statistical distribution by taking the (mean, median and mode) of the star rating for the Vine and non-Vine reviews.
